# Caterpillar

This project uses two main turtles: one to draw the caterpillar and one to draw the leaves. The code places each new leaf at a random location. When the program detects that a leaf has been eaten, the variables storing the score, the speed of the caterpillar, and its length are increased. A function figures out if the caterpillar has moved outside the window, which would signal the end of the game.

To play the game type in your terminal window:
